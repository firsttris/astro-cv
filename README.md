# Curriculum Vitae with Astro

Curriculum Vitae with [Astro](https://astro.build/)

## Motivation

- Recruiters often request a CV in Word format to convert it to their layout, sometimes even altering the content. To prevent this, I decided to create an HTML CV that cannot be changed.
- A CV coded in JavaScript allows you to showcase your skills directly through the CV itself.
- It ensures consistent styling and format, making it easier to update the data.
- I wanted to create a multi-language CV.

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
